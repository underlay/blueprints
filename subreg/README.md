## Scripts + documentation for experimental subregistries.  

Each topical subregistry should have a directory here containing related scripts, and a directory on dataverse with datasets.

Current examples:  
* `recipes/` scripts to scrape and parse a collection of recipes specified by a set of source urls (current source example: borscht)
* citation graphs (patents-scholarship, wiki)
* complex sources
